* Sign in with Apple ID
* Key repeating - `defaults write -g KeyRepeat -int 1 && defaults write -g InitialKeyRepeat -int 12`

* Disable the press and hold for special characters - `defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false`
* In System Settings -> Desktop & Dock -> Desktop & Stage Manager change "Click wallpaper to reveal desktop" to "Only in Stage Manager"

    - Note: When installing things, you might see an error about not being trustworthy. This command bypasses that ðŸ¤·: xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/bin/nvim/bin/nvim
    - Golang (do this first and verify you can run `go`, maybe that'll help avoid the pain and suffering of some neovim plugin installs creating lockfiles and not deleting them)
    - oh-my-zsh
    - powerline10k
    - Neovim
        o Use repo for configs
    - AstroVim (dependencies are listed on the astrovim site)

        o Go to profiles->terminal:
            ^ Disable "Show mark indicators"
            ^ Enable mouse reporting and report mouse wheel events, but disable mouse clicks and drags. This lets you click and drag to select things like you'd expect, but also lets you scroll like you'd expect.
    - Karabiner (key remapper) - **NOTE** Looks like you can change these keybindings in System Settings now, need to verify
        o For the Glove80, make it so the function keys work as function keys
    - Scroll Reverser (natural scrolling on trackpad, but not on mouse)
    - OneDrive
    - Raycast - window snapping and clipboard history
    - VS Code
    - Telegram
    - Obsidian
    - Docker
    - k8s
    - k9s
    - Keepass
    - Strongbox - keepass
    - Outlook (optional)
        o Disable focused inbox
    - Run `git` from the terminal, this triggers the developer package installation thing for macs
    - fzf-zsh-plugin
    - powerline10k
    - node
    - Zeal (brew install all the dependencies, then build (it worked the first time ðŸ˜±))
    - fzf-tab
    - Homebrew
        o vim
        o python
        o exa (didn't work)
        o bat
        o chafa
	    o direnv
        o exiftool
        o fd
        o --cask temurin
        o graphviz
        o helm
        o wget
        o tmux
            - Run <leader>-I to install plugins after moving in the ~/.tmux.conf (yes, that is a capital I (probably))
        o tmuxinator
	    o ripgrep
	    o fzf (don't forget to do the setup from the readme: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-up-shell-integration)
* Make sure `$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND` is set to `fd --type f --hidden --follow --exclude .git`
* Edit ~/.p10k.zsh and change truncate_to_unique to truncate_to_last
* vscode/cursor
    - Run cmd+shift+p, then type "shell", then select "Shell Command: Install 'code' in PATH"
    - Go to the "Tree Indent" setting and change the pixel indent to something non-stupid like 30
    - Extensions:
        o plantuml
    - Vim settings:
        ```
        ...
        "vim.insertModeKeyBindings": [
            {
                "before": ["j", "k"],
