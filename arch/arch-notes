# Arch Setup

Notes for setting up a new Omarchy system.

## Programs I've installed

Pacman:
* ruby
* ruby-erb
* tmux
* python-debugpy
* keyd (I think, it might have already been installed)
* direnv

Ruby (`gem install`):
* tmuxinator

Manual:
* nvim-dap
* fzf


## Configure

* keys -> /etc/keyd/default.conf (I should save a copy of this)
  - Run `sudo keyd reload` after making a change
* OneDrive
  - I'm not sure what I did to install onedrive, but here are some configurations
  - ~/.config/systemd/user/onedrive-sync.service and ~/.config/systemd/user/onedrive-sync.timer
  - `systemctl --user daemon-reload`
  - `systemctl --user enable --now onedrive-sync.timer`
* tmux-resurrect
  - After setting up tmux-resurrect, run this command so saving environments actually works: `mkdir -p ~/.tmux/resurrect && set -g @resurrect-dir '/home/greg/.tmux/resurrect'`
* External monitors
  - Run `intel-gpu-dev-path.sh`
  - Copy `.config/uwsm` files over (if you haven't already)
* Move `.config` files over

## Problems

* Vim setup: treesitter was causing problems, but `:Lazy sync` seems to have resolved them. I think.
