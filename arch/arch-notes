# Arch Setup

Notes for setting up a new Omarchy system.

## Programs I've installed

Pacman:
* ruby
* ruby-erb
* tmux
* python-debugpy
* keyd
* direnv

Ruby (`gem install`):
* tmuxinator

Manual:
* nvim-dap
* fzf

Forgot-where-it-came-from:
* envycontrol


## Configure

* keys -> /etc/keyd/default.conf (I saved a copy of this, just rename it and put it in place)
  - Run `sudo keyd reload` after making a change
* OneDrive
  - I'm not sure what I did to install onedrive, but here are some configurations
  - ~/.config/systemd/user/onedrive-sync.service and ~/.config/systemd/user/onedrive-sync.timer
  - `systemctl --user daemon-reload`
  - `systemctl --user enable --now onedrive-sync.timer`
* tmux-resurrect
  - After setting up tmux-resurrect, run this command so saving environments actually works: `mkdir -p ~/.tmux/resurrect && set -g @resurrect-dir '/home/greg/.tmux/resurrect'`
* External monitors
  - Run `intel-gpu-dev-path.sh`
  - Copy `.config/uwsm` files over (if you haven't already)
* Run `sudo envycontrol -s nvidia` -> this lets me use multiple monitors at the same time, though it isn't ideal (pretty sure it nullifies the above step :()
* Move `.config` files over
* Move `monitor-hotplug.sh` to `~/bin` or wherever makes sense
* Delete `~/.config/git` -> it has weird configs I don't like

## Problems

* Vim setup: treesitter was causing problems, but `:Lazy sync` seems to have resolved them. I think.
